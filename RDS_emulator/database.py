    Sample usage:
    with session_scope() as session:
        session.DATABASE_QUERY

    Abstracts the handling of the session object. A new thread-safe session
    is created automatically, connected to the currently active database. When
    reaching the end of the with block, the session automatically tries to
    commit all uncommited changes. If the commit fails, or an exception is
    raised while processing the queries, a rollback of all changes is
    automatically performed and the exception is escalated. Regardless of
    the success or failure to commit, the session is automatically closed and
    released to the database at the end of the with block.

    Note that ORM objects retrieved using a session are no longer usable after
    the session has been closed. All changes must thus be performed within a
    single with block, or the objects has to be queried again from the new
    session object.

    This context manager is inspired by the SQLAlchemy session tutorial:
